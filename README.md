ðŸš€ Features
â€¢ Ask any natural language question.
â€¢ Searches the web using real-time search APIs (e.g., SerpAPI).
â€¢ Scrapes top relevant URLs using BeautifulSoup or Playwright.
â€¢ Combines scraped content into a unified context.
â€¢ Sends the context + question to an LLM (like OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4).
â€¢ Returns a summarized, accurate answer based on live data.
 
 ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
â€¢	Frontend Technology: Next.js
â€¢	Backend Technology: FastAPI

ðŸŽ¯ Goal
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to:

Combine real-time web data with LLMs to generate factual, up-to-date answers.
Mimic the intelligent, citation-driven UX of tools like Perplexity.ai.
Build a practical, production-like full-stack AI-powered app.
